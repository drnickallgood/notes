### Startup Work

- Got a websocket basic client working with python between dev server and
  other server

- Need to expand and make the remote server do something, and return a
  value, something simple maybe like math?

- Need to look into auth stuff too for websockets....

- Need to also look into nginx proxying.. but that's later

    2.  Need to do websockets client in tornado as a test...
